## Predictive Analysis of Sleep Health and Lifestyle Factors: A Python-Based Data Mining Framework 

This repository accompanies the research paper “Predictive Analysis of Sleep Health and Lifestyle Factors: A Python-Based Data Mining Framework” by Assna V.S., MCA Student, LEAD College, Palakkad, India.

The project develops a Python-driven computational framework for analyzing behavioral and physiological determinants of sleep health using a dataset of 374 participants. The framework integrates:

Conditional logic structures for automated classification of sleep quality and risk levels

Iterative and modular processing for demographic and occupational subgroup analysis

NumPy for numerical computation and correlation matrix derivation

pandas for grouped aggregation, cross-tabulation, and data export

Empirical findings reveal strong inverse relationships between stress and sleep quality (r = -0.62, p < 0.001), and positive associations between physical activity and sleep duration improvements.

The framework demonstrates the potential of computational automation in health analytics, contributing to scalable, reproducible, and interpretable data mining methodologies in preventive medicine.
